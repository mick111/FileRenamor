===========
To be done :
- [up/down buttons] optional, prefer usage of cmd+up/down
- [drag and drop folders/recursive folder] optional
- instantaneous name calculation (when token field is modified, when table view is modified)
- [validate regexp / replace & tokenField user entries (forbiden character)] optional
- [Retrieve cursor position in token field to add tokens at current position] quite difficult

Known bugs
- all rows are deselected when checkbox is clicked (???)
- Undefined behavior for invalid characters in input (eg, usage of '/')
- Undefined behavior when two files names result on the same name.
